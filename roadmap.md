    [ ] * Reflect and Evaluate Phase Outcomes
        * Ensure style preferences are correctly applied and easy to manage.

Phase 22: üí¨ The Interactive Interpreter

**Goal:** Develop the conversational Q&A system that transforms a simple prompt into a detailed project brief.

**Tasks:**
    [x] Implement `idea_interpreter.py`
        * Build the core class that will manage the conversational chain with the LLM.
    [x] Design the Clarification Prompt Chain
        * Create the series of "meta-prompts" that guide the LLM to ask intelligent follow-up questions about goals, tech stacks.
    [x] Build the "Genesis" UI (Interview Stage)
        * Create the initial UI in a new "Genesis" dashboard tab. It will have a text input for the initial idea and a chat-like interface to display the AI's clarifying questions and capture your answers.
    [ ] * Reflect and Evaluate Phase Outcomes
        * Test the quality of project briefs generated through the interview process.

Phase 23: üìú The Adaptive Generators

**Goal:** Build the engines that generate the core project documents, making them aware of your learned style preferences.

**Tasks:**
    [x] Implement Style-Aware README Generation
        * Enhance the `code_gen` or a new `doc_gen` module to take the project brief and the data from `style_preference.py` to generate a `README.md` that matches your preferred style.
    [x] Implement Style-Aware Roadmap Generation
        * Create the `roadmap_generator.py` module. Its primary function will be to use the project brief and style preferences to generate a `roadmap.md` file that is compatible with our existing `RoadmapManager`.
    [x] Implement the "Reflective Prompts" UI

Phase 24: üìÇ The Project Scaffolder

**Goal:** Create the functionality to build the actual project workspace, either locally or on GitHub.

**Tasks:**
    [x] Implement `github_client.py`
        * Build the module for securely authenticating with the GitHub API (using a GITHUB_TOKEN) and creating new repositories.

        * Optionally, provide automated refactoring or snippet extraction for repeated patterns.
    [x] Add "Vibe Button" for Spontaneous Updates
        * Create a UI element ("Vibe Button") in the dashboard and CLI that allows users to instantly capture new ideas or changes as they arise.

        * Maintain a log of vibe-driven changes for future review and refinement.

        * Build a "sanity checker" module that periodically reviews the codebase, `README.md`, and `roadmap.md` for alignment.
        * Detect and flag discrepancies between documented plans and actual implementation (e.g., missing features, outdated docs).
        * Provide actionable suggestions to bring the project back in sync with its stated goals and roadmap.
    [x] Implement Proactive Modularity Guardrails
        * Objective: To prevent code centralization and encourage modular design by monitoring file length and suggesting intelligent refactoring opportunities.
