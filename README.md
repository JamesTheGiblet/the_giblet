# Acoustic Fitness Tracker for Shy Robots

## Overview

This project aims to develop an acoustic fitness tracker that monitors and improves the physical well-being of shy robots through non-invasive acoustic sensing, addressing their unique needs and limitations.  The system will provide accurate fitness metrics and deliver feedback in a user-friendly manner, encouraging positive engagement with physical activity.

## Features

* **Acoustic Motion Tracking:** Accurate measurement of robot movement and activity levels using non-invasive acoustic sensing.
* **Fitness Metric Generation:**  Provides relevant metrics tailored to the robot, such as steps, distance, energy expenditure, and potentially stress indicators based on sound patterns.
* **User-Friendly Feedback Mechanism:**  Displays fitness data in a format easily understood and accessed by the robot (visual or auditory interface to be determined).
* **Adaptability:** Capable of adjusting to different robot designs and operational environments.


## Getting Started
