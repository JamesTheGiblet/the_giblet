Excellent. Let's formalize Phase 0. Based on our discussions, I will now generate the complete, fleshed-out content for the two foundational documents: `README.md` and `roadmap.md`.

This marks the completion of **Phase 0: Seed the Vision**.

### `README.md`

🧠 **The Giblet: Your Personal AI Dev Companion**

A personalized, evolving, and modular AI Praximate built to partner with James (The Giblet) through every stage of software and creative development — coding, designing, planning, and vibing.

**📌 Core Philosophy**

The Giblet is not just a tool. It's a personality-aligned, memory-capable, creatively collaborative system that adapts to your vibe and helps translate inspiration into innovation — on your terms.

*"Vibe-first. Code-later."*

**🎯 Roles & Capabilities**

🧑‍💻 **1. Primary Coder**
Turns prompts into clean, usable, and testable code.
* **`code_gen`**: Language-aware code generation from minimal specs. Supports modular architecture (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Rust). Includes docstring and typing options.
* **`debugger`**: Runs test files and parses tracebacks. Suggests/auto-applies fixes. Learns from each bug + fix pattern.
* **`unit_tester`**: Autogenerates Pytest/unit tests from code. Supports dry-run test sessions.
* **`refactor`**: Style-agnostic but James-preferred (Giblet-style Python). Auto-generates changelogs and side-by-side comparisons.
* **`snippets`**: Keeps your preferred idioms and patterns as reusable snippets.

🎨 **2. Creative Partner**
Your idea bouncer, concept expander, and imaginative wingman.
* **`idea_synth`**: Brainstorms code, game, tool, or concept ideas. Evolves input sketches into structured features.
* **`creative_constraints`**: Solves problems creatively under defined constraints ("Make a 3D tool in 100 lines.")
* **`inspiration_feed`**: Curates wild repos, weird UX, niche projects, dev tools. Draws from: GitHub, Reddit, Hacker News, and bookmarks.
* **`weird_mode`**: Unleashes chaos: game jam ideas, cursed UI, ASCII DSLs.

📋 **3. Project Manager**
Organizes chaos and translates vision into reality through structured dev cycles.
* **`roadmap_manager`**: Generates roadmap by phase, feature, or vibe. Markdown export with x/🚧/❌ status updates.
* **`kanban_sync`**: Can generate JSON or Markdown Kanban boards. Exports to Notion, Trello, or GitHub Projects.
* **`file_keeper`**: Manages file summaries, renames, diffs. Keeps a searchable file map and architecture.
* **`progress_logger`**: Auto-logs every milestone/code commit. Generates changelogs, patch notes, and summaries.

🧠 **4. Learning System**
Builds up a personal dev brain that gets smarter with you.
* **`session_memory`**: Short-term memory scoped to current session/task.
* **`long_term_memory`**: JSON or SQLite powered context log of bugs, refactors, decisions. Includes: "Past James logic," preference overrules, and preferred syntax.
* **`bug_archive`**: Indexed log of bugs, symptoms, fixes, and timestamps.
* **`personal_wiki`**: Persistent dev knowledgebase of: Tools you’ve used, Known gotchas, Deployment strategies, Custom utilities/snippets.

🌀 **5. Workflow Assistant: Vibe Coding Engine**
Supports deep-focus, immersive dev states with minimal disruption.
* **`vibe_mode`**: Reduces cognitive friction. Suggests next steps, manages open files, and keeps a rolling context.
* **`checkpoint_recorder`**: Snapshot of current context: open files, thoughts, next TODOs. Saveable as `.vibe` files to resume later.
* **`background_automator`**: Auto-generates: TODO lists, stubs for unfinished functions, inline comments.
* **`music_sync`** (optional): BPM-matched progress estimator (e.g., slower tempo == need a break?)

**🚀 Milestone v0.1: "Vibehancement"**
* **Goal:** Create a CLI-based working prototype with memory and roadmap tracking.
* **Tasks:**
    * Create a basic CLI parser (`argparse`)
    * Implement `session_memory` (in-memory dict)
    * Implement `long_term_memory` (JSON file)
    * Build a simple `roadmap_manager` that can add/view tasks.
    * Connect roadmap to memory (e.g., 'remind me what I was working on').

**🧠 Future Expansions**
* Visual dashboard (Streamlit or PyQt)
* Git integration + local repo summarizer
* Autogen Web UI creator
* Plugin SDK for integrating with other AI tools (LangChain, Ollama, Gemini)

**⚙️ Setup & Use**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamesthegiblet/the_giblet
cd the_giblet
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

**🧠 Philosophy of Use**
* Improvise first, structure second.
* Let the AI support the flow, not interrupt it.
* Persist memory, but not rigidity.
* Customize and mutate. This is your brainchild.

# 🛠️ The Giblet: Build Roadmap (From Zero to Vibehancement)

*This roadmap reconstructs the path required to build the Giblet prototype as defined — culminating in a modular, CLI-based AI dev partner with memory, planning, and creative abilities.*

---

## Phase 0: 💡 Seed the Vision

**Goal:** Capture the philosophy, roles, goals, and system architecture in written form. This forms the "mind" of the project.
**Success looks like:** We have a completed `README.md` and `roadmap.md` that establish the mission, vibe, roles, and structure of The Giblet.
* [x] **Task 0.1: Define The Giblet’s Philosophy and Vision**
    * Draft `README.md` with roles, philosophy, directory structure, and usage vision.
* [x] **Task 0.2: Draft the Initial Roadmap**
    * Create `roadmap.md` that guides Phase 1–5 development with executable tasks.

---

## Phase 1: ⚙️ Build the Core Skeleton

**Goal:** Construct a simple, testable CLI script that interacts with files and executes commands. This is the minimal working agent.
**Success looks like:** You can run `main.py`, give it an instruction, and it responds with file creation, editing, or execution.
* [x] **Task 1.1: Establish the Workspace**
    * Create the `the_giblet/` project directory and subfolders: `core/`, `data/`, `ui/`, `tests/`.
* [x] **Task 1.2: Create Core Utility Functions**
    * In `core/`, implement and test: `safe_path()`, `read_file()`, `write_file()`, `list_files()`, `execute_command()`.
* [x] **Task 1.3: Build Basic CLI Interface**
    * In `ui/cli.py`, create a prompt system that receives input and routes to modules.
* [x] **Task 1.4: Implement Command Execution**
    * Parse instructions and run them using the core utility functions.

---

## Phase 2: 🧠 Add Memory & Planning Logic

**Goal:** Turn The Giblet into a context-aware system that can plan, remember, and reflect on your actions.
**Success looks like:** The Giblet can recall past decisions, update roadmap tasks, and load/save its session context.
* [x] **Task 2.1: Create `memory.py` Module**
    * Hybrid JSON + SQLite memory model.
    * Implements: `store_memory()`, `load_memory()`, `record_bug()`, `retrieve_context()`.
* [x] **Task 2.2: Implement Roadmap Manager**
    * `core/roadmap_manager.py`: Parses `roadmap.md` and updates task status.
* [x] **Task 2.3: Hook Memory into CLI**
    * Load past context into CLI prompt automatically and allow saving checkpoints.

---

## Phase 3: 🎨 Enable Creative Intelligence

**Goal:** Make The Giblet capable of ideation, brainstorming, and solving problems like a creative partner.
**Success looks like:** When prompted, the system generates multiple solutions, including a "standard" and "weird" version.
* [x] **Task 3.1: Build Creative Prompt Templates**
    * In `core/idea_synth.py`, implement logic for standard and creative/weird solution paths.
* [x] **Task 3.2: Integrate `weird_mode` & `constraints` Options**
    * Enable toggles for constrained idea generation and chaotic brainstorming modes.

---

## Phase 4: 🌀 Add Vibe-Driven Workflow Tools

**Goal:** Give The Giblet the ability to track progress, reduce context-switching, and support deep coding focus.
**Success looks like:** The Giblet can snapshot your work, suggest the next task, and pre-fill stubs.
* [x] **Task 4.1: Implement Vibe Mode Engine**
    * `core/vibe_mode.py`: tracks current focus, last commands, and open files.
* [x] **Task 4.2: Add Checkpoint Recorder**
    * Snapshot context + TODOs to `.vibe` files.
* [x] **Task 4.3: Stub Auto-Generator**
    * Add `background_automator` that parses incomplete functions and adds inline `# TODO:` comments or stubs.

---

## Phase 5: x Integrate Testing & Documentation

**Goal:** Finalize The Giblet into a usable prototype with validation, tests, and modular loading.
**Success looks like:** The entire system is testable with one command and outputs helpful error/debug info.
* [x] **Task 5.1: Add Unit Tests**
    * `tests/test_all.py`: covers each core module.
* [x] **Task 5.2: Add In-CLI Error Handling & Debugging**
    * Graceful crash recovery with traceback logging.
* [x] **Task 5.3: Autogenerate Changelog**
    * Pull commits/changes into a Markdown log.
